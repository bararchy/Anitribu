===============================================================================
I. > > > >  Quest Updates and Additions
===============================================================================


  A) Introduction

      VTMB offers a very unique experience for most of the playable vampire
      clans. However, I was disappointed with the Ventrue experience. Powerful
      Ventrue are suppose to be able to bend the will of anyone to do their 
      bidding... human or vampire. Their mind control ability is suppose to 
      make them the most powerful vampire class the game has to offer. Not 
      because of what THEY can do, but because of what they can make others 
      do. 

      To fully realize a Ventrue's powers, you would need to be able to do
      more than simply gather additional information from dialogs. A true
      ventrue doesn't do their own fighting. They cultivate armies of servants
      who do their fighting for them. This was the experience I was looking
      for. And since the game didn't have it, I decided to add it myself.

      This mod was originally intended to be a Ventrue enhancement mod, but
      has slowly evolved into more. Today, any clan can create parties, some
      NPCs will travel with you willingly and there is even an option to 
      embrace a human later in the game.


  B) The Animus Constupro 

      The Animus Constupro is an ancient parasitic creature who's cursed
      blood enslaves all who taste it. You will find the Animus Constupro 
      about a quarter of the way through the game towards the end of the 
      Alistair Grout quest. This item is required to create most of your party. 

      Originally,  the Animus Constupro was only going to be require  for
      unusual characters: Vampires, Ghouls, Non-humans.  However, I 
      discovered during the development of the mod that MOST characters
      in this game are not normal everyday humans. Therefore, it was decided
      that the Animus Constupro would be required for all characters except a
      rare few who will travel with you willingly. 

      The mod still caters to clans with mind control abilities, but with some 
      effort, any clan can cultivate a party of super ghouls. 

      IMPORTANT NOTE:

      Only Heather and Yukie are available as traveling companions without
      the Animus Constupro. For this reason, you may wish to stick to the
      main plot and avoid side quests until you have the creature in your 
      possession. Otherwise, you may miss potential companion options. See 
      III.A below for more details.

II. > > > >  Installation
===============================================================================

  A. Non-Steam Users:
  -------------------

    1) [Optional] Backup your current VTMB installation

        Save games were expanded to include party information. Therefore old 
        save games will not be compatible with the Companion Mod. Nor will 
        your new save games be compatible with the original game.

        It is possible to have 2 versions of the game installed on 1 computer. 
        You can play either version so long as there is at least 1 legitimate
        copy of the game installed. 

        This allows you to play VTMB with or without the companion mod. However, 
        backing up the original installation requires that you have enough 
        hard disk space for 2 copies of the game (Generally 10 Gig minimum 
        is recommended). 

       - Rename the current installation directory. Typically:

         C:\Program Files\Activision\Vampire the Masquerade - Bloodlines

         should be renamed to :

         C:\Program Files\Activision\VTBM - Original

    2) Uninstall any existing copy of VTMB

       ** follow these instructions even if you renamed the directory in the 
          previous step

         - Insert the CD and select "Uninstall". 

         - When prompted, Delete all local content.


    3) Clean up Previous Mod Artifacts

       VTMB's uninstaller only removes files that were installed by VTMB. If
       you have installed other mods or patches, those files are not cleaned 
       up and may present issues. 

       Using Explorer, browse to the directory where VTMB was installed.

       Typically:

       C:\Program Files\Activision\Vampire the Masquerade - Bloodlines

       If a directory exists named "Vampire the Masquerade - Bloodlines", 
       right click and delete completly from the computer.

       ** Do not delete the directory "VTMB - Original" if you backed up the 
          directory in optional step 1. 

    4) Install a fresh Copy of VTMB:

       - Insert CD 1 and select Install. Follow the instructions.

    5) Install the Official 1.2 patch. 

         http://www.vampirebloodlines.com/patch/

    6) Unzip compmod_1.0.zip using winzip

       ** The 7z file was compressed using winzip as most file share sites
          only support zip files. 

    7) Extract compmod_1.0.7z file to:

       C:\Program Files\Activision\Vampire the Masquerade - Bloodlines

       ** Requires 7Zip version 4.60+ (Free Software) http://www.7-zip.org
       ** Make sure that "Current Pathnames" is checked. 
       ** Make sure "Overwrite without prompt" is checked. 

    8) DO NOT INSTALL ANY PATCHES ON TOP OF THIS MOD! -> It will break the mod.

    NOTE : If you have Vista 64 and you experience problems with this mod, you 
           may have to run "INSTALL64" under the tools directory. However, do 
           not run this unless you actually exprerience problems. 


  B. Steam Users: 
  ---------------
     
  1) [Optional] Backup your current VTMB installation

    Old save games will not be compatible with the Companion Mod. Nor will 
    your new save games be compatible with the original game.

    Backing up the original installation requires that you have enough 
    hard disk space for 2 copies of the game (Generally 10 Gig minimum 
    is recommended). 

    Assuming Steam is installed in the default location, normally you will
    find VTMB files in the folder :

    C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\vampire the masquerade - bloodlines

       Browse to the folder "C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\" using
       Windows Explorer. Rename the VTMB install directory to:

    C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\VTMB - Original

  2) Uninstall any existing copy of VTMB

    Open Steam, goto the "My Games" tab. Right click on VTMB and select
    "Delete local content". The game will move to the "not installed" area. 

  3) Clean up Previous Mod Artifacts

    VTMB's uninstaller only removes files that were installed by VTMB. If
    you have installed other mods or patches, those files are not cleaned 
    up and may present issues. 

    Using Explorer, browse to the directory where VTMB was installed.

    Typically:

    C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\vampire the masquerade - bloodlines

    If a directory exists named "Vampire the Masquerade - Bloodlines", 
    right click and delete completly from the computer.

    ** Do not delete the directory "VTMB - Original" if you backed up the 
       directory in optional step 1. 

  4) Install a fresh Copy of VTMB:
     
    - Start Steam
    - Click on "My Games"
    - Right click the VTMB game within the steam window and select 
      "Install Game".

    ** Steam delivered content comes with the 1.2 patch already installed. 

    ** If you run into problems Re-installing. "Your Steam Ticket has expired"
       delete the the "ClientRegistry.blob" file from C:\Program Files\Steam.
       This will force steam to update when it next starts which should fix 
       the problem. 

  5) Start\Exit VTMB:

      Sometimes Steam does not fully extract the contents of your game until 
      you actually launch the game. To be certain steam does not clobber 
      any of the mods changes, you should launch the newly installed Steam 
      version of the game at least once before extracting the mod. 

    - From Within Steam, right click VTMB and select "Launch Game". 
    - Once you reach the Load\Save menu, you can quit.  

  6) Unzip compmod_1.0.zip using winzip

     ** The 7z file was compressed using winzip as most file share sites
        only support zip files. 

  7) Extract compmod_1.0.7z file to:

    C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\vampire the masquerade - bloodlines

    ** Requires 7Zip version 4.60+ (Free Software) http://www.7-zip.org
    ** Make sure that "Current Pathnames" is checked. 
    ** Make sure "Overwrite without prompt" is checked. 

  8) DO NOT INSTALL ANY PATCHES ON TOP OF THIS MOD! -> It will break the mod. 


  NOTE : If you have Vista 64 and you experience problems with this mod, you 
         may have to run "INSTALL64" under the tools directory. However, do 
         not run this unless you actually exprerience problems. 

===============================================================================
III. > > > >  Companion System
===============================================================================

  You can collect up to 7 companions at any given time and you can order up to
  2 of them to travel with you. Those companions who are not traveling with you
  can be placed in an assortment of animated poses around your haven as 
  "decor". 

  A) Gaining Companions


     There are 3 ways to gain companions in this game. 

     1) Friendly Non-Player-Characters (NPCs)

         Some NPCs will willingly join forces with you.

     2) The Embrace

        Later in the game, you will be given the opportunity to embrace one 
        human. Embrace options are limited to those humans who willingly join
        forces with you.

     3) Animus Constupro

        The Animus Constupro is the most common way of gaining a companion.
        This parasitic creature can be found about a quarter of the way 
        through the game during the Alistair Grout quest given to you by 
        LaCroix. The quest is part of the plot and the creature is highlighted 
        within a cut scene, so you can't miss it.

        Once the Animus Constupro is in your possession, you must convince
        people to drink blood from it through dialog.

        If you are Ventrue, Tremere or Malkavian you can use your Mind-Control 
        abilities to "convince" most humans into drinking the creature's blood. 
        Vampires present a greater challenge. You can use Mind-Control on 
        Vampires, but they will typically shrug off the attempt. It may work,
        but only if you catch them off guard by doing it to someone who trusts
        you.

        There are other ways to get vampires to drink the blood. Trickery, 
        persuasion and timing are tools of the trade. For example, while a 
        Vampire may not trust you, often times Vampires have Ghouls or allies 
        that they DO trust. If you learn the identity of these people and then
        possess their allies, you can often trick a Vampire into drinking 
        blood under false pretenses.

          NOTE: Once an NPC has been fed the Animus Constupro, they may never
                be the same again and any future quests that they might have
                given you may no longer be available. Keep this in mind when
                deciding whether to pursue an NPC as a party member. 

  B) Combat

     Companions will not initiate a fight unless you attack first. They will 
     not blow your cover when playing stealth. If you attack an enemy (or you
     are discovered), companions will back you up and attack anyone who is 
     hostile towards you.

     You can tell your companion through dialog how you want them to fight.
     The options are:

       - General : Ranged, Switch to Melee if enemy gets too close
       - Melee Only : If you are fighting vampires, most ranged weapons are 
                      useless.
       - Hide : (Don't fight)

     Companions use a different system than the PC for health. They can take
     a certain number of hits based on their endurance and your level. After
     they absorb their max hits, they fall to the ground unconscious for 2 min
     or until combat is over (whichever comes first). When they get up, their
     hits reset. These hit counters do not reset between fights or even areas.
     They only reset when a companion falls and gets back up.

     Your Level is based on your attributes, skills and disciplines. Following
     the tutorial, most people will start the game at level 2. If you max out
     all of your attributes, skills and disciplines, you would be considered
     level 20. Note that unallocated experience points do not contribute to
     your level, thus companions will remain weak in combat if you stock 
     pile your experience.

     As a rule of thumb, most companions can take a number of hits equivalent
     to your level. (Give or take up to 20 percent based on their unique
     stamina)


  C) Possession

     Starting Possession

         You begin possession by choosing the "<Possess>" option from your 
         traveling companions dialog.

     Possession Details

         When you possess a companion you gain their body, stats and powers.
         You are not responsible for what a possessed companion does. If you
         kill a human or break the Masquerade while possessing a companion,
         the humanity loss or violation is incurred by the companion. When you
         un-possess, it will be as though you did nothing wrong. If you have
         extra experience points and you spend them on the companion, they will
         be given back to you when you un-possess.

         While possessing someone, you can try to start a dialog. Most the time
         the game will treat you as if you are the same gender, clan, etc... as
         the possessed NPC. In some cases the game will auto-un-possess, and in
         some rare cases you will get new custom dialog because the NPC you are
         talking to recognizes you. (See the Spoilers section for more 
         details.)

     Ending Possession

         There are 3 ways possession can end:

         1) You talk to the Protagonists body and end possession manually

            This one is pretty self explanatory

         2) The possessed companions health drops to 0 for more than 10 seconds

            When the body of a possessed NPC takes too much damage, possession
            automatically ends. In most cases, The NPC's body falls and you are
            teleported back to the PC's body (where ever you have stashed it).
            During boss fights, you will not teleport. You will simply become
            the PC again and continue fighting from your current location. This
            is because Boss Fights generally lock the doors behind you and I
            didn't want players teleporting outside of the area with no ability
            to get back in.

         3) You begin a dialog with someone that possessed NPC is not allowed 
            to talk to.

            Explanation: If you possess the owner of a bar and talk to the 
            bartender, you would expect the bartender to recognize you. 
            However, if you talked to the prostitute outside, it wouldn't
            really matter who you are. The Compmod uses pre-defined reaction
            tables to decides who is allowed to talk to who. If it detects a
            conflict between the person you are possessing and the person you
            are talking to, it will auto-end possession. It happens most often
            when talking to main characters such as LaCroix or Nines who always
            talk to you as though you are the protagonist.

            Malkavians are an exception to this rule. Possessed Malkavians will
            rarely if ever auto-un-possess when beginning dialog. If you want
            to get philosophical, then just pretend they make everyone see the
            protagonist. But in reality I wanted to provide access to their
            Dementation discipline during dialog for those clans without
            mind-control abilities.


  D) Outfits

     Each character in the game has a directory that contains models and skins
     for the character. The companion mod scans the characters directory for
     models and allows you tell people to "Change Outfits" if additional models 
     are detected. It is really that simple. 

     If additional models are found, you will see "Change outfit" options in
     your dialog with the companion. Mod supports the concept of installable 
     outfit packs which can be added at a later time and will not break save
     games. 

     See website section : Media/Images for screenshots of some of the outfit
     options that come pre-installed with the mod.

  E) Animated Poses

     One of the things you can do with companions is place them around your
     haven as decor. This functionality is only available on companions who are
     not travelling with you.

     Starting the Pose System

         The pose system is initiated using dialog. The exact wording changes
         from NPC to NPC, but it generally includes the word "Pose". After it
         is initialized, a message will appear on the screen telling you to
         use KP_0 (Keypad 0) for help or KP_Enter (Keypad Enter) to end the
         pose system.

     Moving the Companions

         When the pose system starts, the companion becomes attached to you.
         When you move, they move with you like an object that you have picked
         up. You can also make fine grain adjustments to their position using
         the keypad. The default movement keys are as follows:

         KP_LEFTARROW : Rotate Companion to the right
         KP_RIGHTARROW : Rotate Companion to the left
         KP_UPARROW : Raise Companion into the air. (typically to place on an
                      object such as a bed or chair)
         KP_DOWNARROW : Lower Companion
         KP_PGUP : Lean companion backward (so that they are facing down

     Modifying Pose Key setup


         You can change the default pose system key setup by editing the file
         Vampire\cfg\mods.cfg.

  F) Known Bugs

     There are some minor bugs (more like irritations) that are known. Below
     is a list with tips on how to fix or avoid.

     - Do not use the pose system from third person perspective (IE: when you
       can see the Protagonist). If the companion you are posing comes into
       contact with the protagonists model, the PC may be thrown off map. Only
       pose from first person perspective.

     - It is possible to use the "get behind me" companion command to teleport
       your companion through walls or around fences. If you then proceed to
       possess the companion through the fence, you can gain access to areas
       that the game developers never meant for you to enter. If you actually
       walk around and talk to people, you will likely break the game as you
       will be doing things out of sequence. You may even fall off the map.
       Do not possess through fences, walls or doors to gain access to
       inaccessible areas

     - If you hit anyone, your traveling companions will attack them. 
       Unfortunately, this includes members of your party and even your fellow
       traveling companions. This is part of the game's AI and I cant stop
       or detect the behavior. Luckily, you can.

       If you accidentally hit a traveling companion and the other companion
       begins to attack them: Squat on the ground. Within 15 seconds both
       companions will go invisible (and stop fighting since they cant see
       each other). Talk to either one and tell them to "Find the other
       servant and bring them here". This will re-spawn the other companion
       and stop the fighting.

       If you accidentally hit a party member in your haven. You can either
       leave the haven and return (thus re-spawning both of your traveling
       companions) or you can talk to any of your haven companions 
       (non-traveling companions) and tell them to "Round everyone up and tell
       them to return to their starting positions". This will re-spawn everyone

       in the haven and thus stop the fighting as well. If you have spent any
       time posing people, you will probably want to use the "leave the haven"
        option.

     - When posing NPCs, if you somehow manage to lose an NPC (ie, they fall
       off map and you accidentally hit ENTER instead of Re-Center), you can
       approach any NPC in the haven and tell them "Round everyone up and
       tell them to return to their starting positions". This dialog option
       is basically a haven reset. You can also use this dialog option if
       you accidentally place an NPC in a location where you can not start
       dialog with them. (The most common place is the shower).

     - NPCs teleport behind you if they get too far away or remain idle for
       15 seconds. I have found some issues when using elevators as an NPC may
       teleport behind you and block the elevator from going up/down. If you
       find yourself in an elevator that isn't moving, back up against a wall
       so that when your companion idle teleports, they get out of the 
       elevators way. Alternatively, you can reload an auto-save.

     - Some companions may act strangely when standing at idle. For example,
       arms stretched out and head looking at the ground. This is an engine
       bug that I can't fix, however I have found that the behavior often
       goes away when I quit/restart the game. A restart is necessary. Simply
       reloading a saved game does not fix the issue.


   G) Reporting Bugs
     
     Before submitting a bug, be certain you have the latest version of the 
     CompanionMod. 

     When you submit a bug, provide clear instructions on how to reproduce it 
     and do not forget to include:

       - Version of Companion Mod
       - Graphics Card
       - Amount of RAM (There are known issues with VTMB on machines with
                        more than 3.5 GB of ram)
       - Be certain you are not out of DiskSpace on the drive that 
         contains VTMB. (You should have at least 2 gigs of free
         space). 
       - Version of VTMB (Steam, Digital Distribution or Retail)
       - OS : Windows XP or Vista
       - Permissions : Are you running as an Admin or standard user?

     Bug Severity: 

        REALLY BAD : Crashes the Game (back to Desktop) in a predictable fashion.
        BAD        : Bug prevents me from being able to finish game period. 
        Normal     : Bug causes a problem, but I can get around it by 
                     reloading a previous saved game
        MILD       : Unexpected behavior, but not necessarily broke. IE: I 
                     see an NPC who is in my party and I talk to them using
                     their own body.  

     Do not send reports for bugs that you can not reproduce.

IV. > > > >  Outfit Pack Creation
===============================================================================

  See the Mod Developers Guide for more details on linking skins to models. 

  Summary : Use VPKTool to open up the mdl file and update the search paths
            to point at a directory with your own custom vmt files that point
            to your own custom texture files all within your own unique 
            directory. 

  Outfit Pack Compatibility:

  If the mdl file for your new model/skin is :

      models/character/npc/unique/downtown/vv/dheu_vv3.mdl
                             |
  The mdl should use textures placed in the following directory :
                             V
      materials/models/character/npc/unqiue/downtown/vv/.dheu_vv3/

  Notes:

  - Texture directory name = "." + mdl name. 
  - Make the texture directory first, then update the mdl. 
  - Yes, the directory starts with a period.
  - Include all non-common textures in the texture directory. (Ie the files 
    that would normally appear within the specific characters texture 
    directory. 

  More Notes:

  - Windows explorer does not allow you to create directories that 
    start with a period. You must use command line (Start -> Run -> cmd).
    to create the directory.
    
      C:\>cd "c:\Program Files\Activision\Vampire - Bloodlines\Vampire..."
      C:\Program Files\Activision\...>mkdir .mydirectory

    Once the directory is created, you can continue using explorer.

  - I would recommend prefixing your model and directory work with an 
    identifiable alias to mitigate the possibility of using the same 
    name as someone else.

  - (suggestion) Zip up your files so that Vampire/models/character/.... 
    and Vampire/materials/models/character... are included in the path so 
    that users can uncompress directly to the VTMB install directory.

===============================================================================
V. > > > >  Release Notes (Recent to oldest)
===============================================================================


  1) Beta 4 :

      - Improved Companion AI:
        -  Companions no longer attack humans that you force feed on outside 
           of combat. (dark alley opportunities)
        -  When you tell a companion to "stay", they no longer go hostile or
           attack nearby enemies if you enter combat.
        -  Fixed stealth bug where companions who were told to stay would begin
           following you again if combat started while you were in stealth.   
      - Added Companion Spawn retry if companion fails to spawn. Normally due to 
        large maps not initializing fast enough. (Hallowbrook was main offender)
      - Damsel Companion Option now active
      - Yukie Companion/Embrace Option now active
        - Yukie is as a travelling companion\Embrace option if you help her 
          with her quest.
        - Yukie will not start a conversation with you, but has new conversation 
          options that will become available as the game progresses. 
      - Fixed bug where "Change Outfit" would not always show up in dialog.
      - All party companions now appear in Santa Monica apartment at end of game
        so that you can select who you wish to take on the final mission(s).

  1) Beta 3 : 

      - Addressed Pose System issues:
        - Help does not display by default
        - User is kept aware that pose system is active by message on screen
        - Exiting the apartment while pose is running should no longer break game or pose system. 
        - Loading a save game while posing should no longer break game or pose system. 
        - Camera now recenters when pose system ends or user changes maps.
        - Added help and tip config options to mods.cfg 

      - Heather Companion Option:
        - Heather is now available as a travelling companion at any point after she 
          approaches you following the Elizabeth Dane quest.

          conversations will become available as the game progresses. 

      - Added Embrace Capability:
        - Following Giovanni Mansion, Lacroix now rewards you with permission to sire
          1 human. The options are Heather or Yuki. For this beta, only heather is available.

        - Added various embraced models+skins for Yukie and Heather

      - Fixed bug with carson companion transition dialog immobilizing PC. 
      - Elevator fixes:
        - Travelling companions will no longer teleport behind you when you enter an 
          elevator. Hopefully this will prevent them from getting in the way of the elevator 
          as you ride it up. (I think I got all the elevators). 

       
  2) Beta 2 : 

      - Added 16 additional companion options (all humans).
      - Updated Pose System to give users more fine grained control over
        positioning, angle, etc... Included help screen which unfortunetly
        required the editing of maps. (Beta 1 save games will not be 
        compatible)
      - Freed up Damsel as a companion option by recreating most of her 
        conversations with Jack.
      - Updated "Found Nines" quest log so that it doesn't mention Damsel

      - Removed Dependendency on local Python (Doh!).
      - Added more Companion Options

      - Added Boss Fight nodes (To prevent teleport if possessed npc dies)
      - Added No-PC-Stay Zone nodes (Cant tell a PC to stay put when 
        possessing). This node helps mitigate other issues on maps. 
      - Updated clandoc000.txt (STEAM bug fix)
      - Updated Possession Systems clanNormalize array (STEAM bug fix)
      - Now uses Buddah instead of invincibility + hit counter during 
        possession so that possessed companion uses a health bar.


  TODO: Version 2.0
  -----------------

    Haven Tasks?

    - Add a dozen tasks or so that you can assign to eligable 
      members of your haven. Maybe renovate your place, make money, find gear.
      I'm open to suggestions.

    Battle cry?

    - When fighting starts (or you are seen), some companions yell a 
      battle cry to let you know that you have been spotted. 

    Haven Scenes?

    - Currently I have the concept of a pose and expression for companions 
      in your haven. Eventually, I would like to have at least 1 if not 2 or 
      3 "scenes" which are basically snapshots of the haven with people
      standing in pre-fabricated positions doing things that make sense for 
      that location. IE: Someone laying on the bed, someone sitting at the 
      bar, someone using the computer, someone watching TV... etc.

      The plan is to implement these dynamically so that like outfit packs,
      you can download ScenesPacks and cycle through them with dialog. Or 
      alternatively, through dialog indicate that you want a random scene 
      every time you enter the haven. I envision scene pack creation to be 
      as simple as pressing a new button while the Pose System is active.

VII > > > >  BETA TESTER NOTES
===============================================================================

  I expect Beta Testers to enable console:

      RETAIL USERS : Right click the icon you use to start the game, go to 
                     properties. Add "-console" to the end of the 
                     executable. It should look like:

      "C:\Program Files\Activision\Vampire - Bloodlines\vampire.exe" -console


      STEAM USERS : Right click VTMB game within Steam, select "Properties" 
                    -> "Set Launch Options". Enter "-console" within the
                    input box to enable console.

                    ** Console will not work with the Steam release of the
                    game under Vista until AFTER you have installed
                    the mod. (Something about the 5.6 patch fixes the
                    vista crashing with console). 

  To aid beta testers, the Animus Constupro (required item) can be quickly
  obtained by typing the command "Cheat()" in the console window. Be certain 
  to use the Tilda (`) key to open and close the window or you may lock up 
  the game. I'm leaving debug Logging fully enabled for the beta release, so
  if something does go wrong, you can grab a snapshot of the console and send
  it to me. 

  Once you start a new game and arrive in your apartment, open the console
  and type "Cheat()". You should see a message telling you that you have
  just recieved the Animus Constupro

  While almost done, Beta 4 is still not complete. The following NPC's are
  == NOT == available as companions options in the Beta release.

     1) Vampires

         Julius   - Santa Monica, Beach
         Copper   - Santa Monica, Beach
         Rosa     - Santa Monica, Beach
         Skelter  - Downtown LA, The Last Round
         Ash      - Hollywood, Asp Hole
         Mitnick  - Hollywood, Warrens

     2) Humans

         Igor        - Downtown LA, Russian Mafia

  If you do not play as Tremere, Malkavian or Ventrue, it may be a while
  before you can begin cultivating companions. A majority of the companions
  are human and require some form of mind control ability to assimilate 
  into your party. After completing the Dane quest, you can assimilate
  Jeanette or Therese and then using their bodies and mind control powers, 
  gain normally unavailable companions.

  Heather will become available as soon as she approaches you following
  the Dane Quest. You do not have to make her a travelling companion 
  immediatly. The option remains open till the end of the game. (In fact, 
  you will not have access to McFly if you make her a travelling companion
  immediatly).  

  TIPS:

  If you wish to test nosferatu embrace without playing as a nosferatu the 
  whole game, save your game and then issue the following command before 
  embracing heather: 

    __main__.G._pcinfo["clan"]=5 

  Note that this will break possession, so you should reload your save game 
  before continuing with your game or change the value back to your real 
  clan:

  2 = brujah
  3 = gangrel
  4 = malkavian
  5 = nosferatu
