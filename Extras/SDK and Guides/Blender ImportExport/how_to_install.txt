Copy the 2 pythons scripts into the scripts directory of blender (important).

Now activate these scripts like this:

Open the menu window (1) and choose scripts window (2), then in the scripts 
window menu (3) choose update menus (4), use the new_way1.jpg to guide you.

You simply have to go to the menu FILE of the main window, choose IMPORT and 
then VampEd_242 (.X). Choose the model d3d.x you have extract with Vamped 
and load it. Remember to extract the MDL as well if you want to export into 
the MDL. Do the same thing for VampEd_mdl.py for the export.

Good luck
