Okay, I have wrote another script for Blender. This one saves the UV as well 
as the vertices. For that you need to extract the MDL of the model. Do it 
in the same folder of the d3d.x model and TGAs when you extract from VampEd. 
I think any version from 0.80 to 0.92 can do it.

All you have to do is choose in the export script menu the Bloodlines_UV 
(.MDLx), then choose the right folder and the right .MDL. The script will 
then try to find the number of vertices and compare that to the number of 
verts in Blender, if it fails a popup will show and the script will terminate.

If it succeeds another popup will tell you that the file was created 
successfully. Now that you have the MDL you must put it in the right folder 
of the game, remove the x in the MDL name, and you should have new UV in 
addition of the new coordinates and vertices and that's it.

Have fun
