Tool to decompress all type 1 or type 2 to type 0.

    Using it with the new SDK (7.9 now) makes  all static prop MDLs work 
with the map editor, the map compiler, the model viewer, the mdl decompiler 
and with the Blender scripts. 
    
    I believe it's working in Bloodlines as well. Tried only once with a 
detail prop I wanted to modified and it worked there so...

    The tool will also try to modify the PC, NPC and some monsters to be 
compatible with the map editor. This is a hack that will work only with the 
editor. Dont try the model elsewhere, it's for the SDK only. I added a 
checkbox to disable that function.


     Usage: Put the vampire dir in the input window or browse for it.
            Decompress and wait!

            The program searches for the model dir and will try to decompress
            all type 1 or type 2 model it will found.

            Then if the checkbox is not check it will try to hack the models 
            into the PC, NPC and monsters dirs.

            Ah yes, the MDL must have been extract from the VPK of course! 

            Dont use this on a game directory, use a separate dir for the SDK.

The tool will not make all dynamics props work. The map editor has a fun way 
to deal will them. Sometimes the prop will end up as a static prop, or it will 
be turned on one axis.

The way I see it, the editor will place the first bone of the prop into the 
origin without doing anything with it but will then turn the bones for some 
other props? The PC and NPC look like they are turned properly but for other 
props they are turned on another axis, and I cannot figure that out. If I 
could I would make another hack to stop it but for now...
 
Have fun,
