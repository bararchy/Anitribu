VPK Builder for Vampire: Bloodlines

About VPK Builder
-----------------
I created this commandline tool, because there only seemed to be VPK extractors around, and no tool to create a VPK which was what I needed. VPK files are archive files used in Vampire:Bloodlines to store game data files.
With this tool you can create VPK files from scratch, which can then be used in Vampire.

Installation
------------
The zip has no installer, but only the program executable. Extract it anywhere you like.

Getting started
---------------
This is a commandline tool so it has no user interface. To use it, open a dos box and go to the directory where you extracted the executable. There run 'vpkbuilder.exe' to see how it's used. The usage is as follows:
vpkbuilder.exe [vpk filename] [directory that contains all the files to add]
First you give the filename you want to use for the VPK file you're creating. After that you give the path to a directory that contains all the files that you want to put inside the archive.
