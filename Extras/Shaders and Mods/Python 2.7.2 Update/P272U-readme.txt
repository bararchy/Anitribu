Python 2.7.2 Update by ColonelAlias
-----------------------------------

Move content of this folder to the Bloodlines installation folder.

New features are a new __main__.console(string) function that 
works like ccmd but doesn't throw a error by default and accepts
arguments, all python libs that don't require dependencies + 
SendKeys and all new python features since 2.1 until 2.7 (lots).

Updated fileutil.py added by Hasimir to support alternate OSes.
