{	1	}{	Hi, Paul. It's Hannah. Just callin' to see how you are. I hope I didn't give you what I've got... uh, I feel like crap. Actually, I need to ask you a favor. Could you pick me up some cold medicine at the store? I hate to bother you, but... I can't seem to get out of bed. The code on my door is 1203. Hey, listen, I, uh... had a really good time the other night. Maybe we could do it again sometime? Sorry... I'm rambling. Okay, bye.	}{	}{	#	}{	}{	G.Killer_Message = 1	}{	}{	}{	}{	}{	}{	}{	}
