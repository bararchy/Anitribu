IMPORTANT: The CompMod uses the model name to determine if someone is embraced. It checks to see if the model ends with "_e". Therefore, Embraced NPC model names must end with "_e" or the companion mod will likely break.

When the CompMod embraces the NPC and the PC is Nosferatu, Compmod appends "_n_e" to the NPC's model. Embracable NPCs therefore must have a "_n_e" model equivalent in this directory for every model in the non-embraced directory (since you dont know what model they will be when they are embraced).

However, you can have additional models in the embraced directory that are not in the non-embraced directory. For example, Yukie has a "darkYukie" option that only becomes available after she is embraced.
