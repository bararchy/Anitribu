//
//How shots work:
//	
//	Shots are given a start position, end position, and a look target. 
//	
//	If there is no "Start" position specified, the camera will start where ever it currently is in the game. 
//	If there is no "Start" position AND this is a new camera without a position, it will start from the player's
//	standard view camera
//
//	If there is no "End" position specified, the camera will not move between the points. 
//
//	If a shot is defined with no "Start" or "End" position, then it's target points can be used by other 
//	functions, such as worldcraft keyframed cameras. 
//
//	If there is both a "Start" and and "End" position specified, the camera will move towards the "End"
//	position each frame. 
//
//	If there is one target point, the camera will turn to face it each frame. 
//	If there are two points, the camera will will track a point halfway between them. 
//

//ShotName		<---- This is what what the shot is called, the name is used by the dialog system to set it up. 
//{
//	Start		<---  This is will the shot will begin. If this is not filled in, the camera will start from whereever it is in the world. 
//	{
//		// this is where the camera will start rendering from 
//		"Position"	"Player"		<--- the local player
//				"DialogTarget"		<--- the npc the player is talking to
//				"GrappleTarget"		<--- the entity the player is grappling
//				"World"			<--- the world's origin (0,0,0)
//				"Named"			<--- the name of an entity in the map 
//
//		// this is how the camera is attached to the position
//		"AttachPos"	"Origin"		<--- The absolute origin of the entity the camera is attached to.
//				"Center"		<--- The middle of this object
//				"EyePosition"		<--- Where the Entity's eye's are (or it's origin if it doesn't have eyes)
//				"Bottom"		<--- The bottom of this object
//				"Top"			<--- The top of this object
//				"Bone: Bip01"		<--- A bone on the entity
//				"Attachment: nozzle"	<--- An attachment point on the entity. 
//
//		
//		"AttachType"	"Follow"		<--- Follow the position of what you are attached to, and 
//							     translate the offset by the attachment's facing
//				"FollowNoAngles"	<--- Follow the position of what you're attached to
//				"None"			<--- don't attach, just set yourself there and don't follow it. 
//				"FollowEntAngles"	<--- Follow the position of what you are attached to, and translate the offset origin by the facing of the entity		
//
//		// if you want the camera to be placed a bit off from the attachment position, fill these in. 
//		"OffsetOrigin"	[0, 0, 0]		<--- This is a [ X, Y, Z ] vector. It might be easier to think of it as
//							     [ Forward/Backward, Right/Left, Up/Down ]
//							     so, for example [ 40, -10, 25 ] would be an offset that is 
//							     40 inches in front of our position, 10 to our left, and 25 above us. 
//
//		<!!	"OffsetAngle"	[0, 0, 0] !!>>	<-- NOTE: This currently isn't implemented. If you think it will be useful, let me know. 
//
//	}
//
//	End	<----- This is where the shot will transition to. If this is not filled in, the camera will not change position.

//	CameraConstraints
//	{
//		"MoveSpeed"		"350"		<--- Speed, in inches/sec, that the camera should move. 
//		"MoveAccel"		"200"		<--- How fast the camera should accelerate and decelerate when moving towardsa destination. 
//
//		"MaxTurnRate"		"[90, 90, 90]"	<--- the camera can't turn more than this many units in a second. 
//							     if it is following a fast moving point, this will keep it from moving too fast.
//		"TurnAccel"		"45"		<--- How fast the camera should accelerate and decelerate when turning to look at something. 
//
//		"DistanceTolerance"	"12"		<--- if we are following an entity, and it moves around a bit, we won't move the camera to follow unless it is more than this many units away. 
//		"AngularTolerance"	"[10, 10, 10]"	<--- if we are following an entity, and it moves around slighltly, we won't tilt the camera unless it is more than this many degrees away from center. 
//		"FieldOfView"		"75"		<--- how wide our field of view is. 
//		"DialogPOV"		"1"		<--- if this is set to 1, NPCs will look at the camera during dialog, rather than the player's eye position. 
//		"AutoPositionFromTarget" "1"		<--- If set to 1, the camera will position itself to the attach
//								pos, and then adjust it's position from the target 
//								points so that they are the very top and bottom of 
//								the screen.
