			9/05/04 - Arthur Kilpatrick - meet Arthur at his place in Santa Monica. Remember to bring the handcuffs and the orange jumpsuit, as he likes to play \"Lock Down at the Women's Prison\". This guy is sick.

			9/07/04 - Vandal B. - 7:30 at the Blood Bank. Bring pliers and the blowtorch.

			9/12/04 - David Hatter - Room 413 at the Luckee Star in Hollywood. He likes that weird umbrella and water balloon thing.

			9/15/04 - Simon Milligan - Downstairs in his room. God I hate that guy.

			9/16/04 - Paul Anderson - An honest to god date! I can't believe he asked me out! I'm so excited!

			9/17/04 - Jezebel Locke? - New client, responded to my ad in the paper. She has a suite at the Empire Hotel. I don't know what to think of this one, but there's something about her... her voice... I don't know. She's offering big bucks so I guess I can't pass it up."
