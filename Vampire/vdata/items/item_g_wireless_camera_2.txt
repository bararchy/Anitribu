	"description"	"The Way of Fire - The ancient anathema of vampires, the element of fire offers the most powerful and dangerous tool available to a Koldunist. The Way of Fire shares aspects with the Way of Earth in that it focuses more on magma and fiery rock than pure, naked flame.
Level 1: Shatter - The Koldunist must have a target in his line of sight and this target spontaneously combusts. Cost 1 blood.
Level 2: Magma Surge - The Koldunist commands magma to bubble up from the earth's core in a radius near koldun. Lasts 10 sec. Cost 2 blood.
Level 3: Gates of Magma - The Koldunist invokes molten rock to bubble up around the koldunist and move with him for 10 sec. Anyone physically touching the Gates of Magma suffers aggravated damage. Cost 3 blood.
Level 4: Heat Wave - The Koldunist calls up hydrogen sulfide from the Earth's mantle and blasts a target. Heat Wave itself finds its target. Lasts 30 sec. Cost 4 blood.
Level 5: Volcanic Blast - The koldunist commands lava to explode from the ground in a huge stream. Magma moves slowly and burns through nearly everyone (even the koldun). Lasts 30 sec. Cost 5 blood."
