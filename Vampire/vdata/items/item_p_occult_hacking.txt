	"description"	"A shield is a type of personal armor, meant to intercept attacks, either by stopping projectiles such as arrows or redirecting a blow from a sword, mace or battle axe to the side of the shield-bearer.
			 Using the shield increases soak for bashing and lethal damage, but can only be used with one-handed weapon: like blades or crushing weapons."
