	"description"	"Vicissitude is a horrid discipline that demands the use of living tissue, muscle and bone.
Grafting these bones into armour and weapons grants +3 to physical attributes, but reduce humanity by 3 and demands 2 blood to meld the plates to your undead flesh.
If you activate 1 level of Vicissitude using this skeleton, then your appearance becomes terrible and will increase your intimidate in dialogues."
