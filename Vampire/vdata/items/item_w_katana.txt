	"printname"	"Sword"
	"description"	"A sword fundamentally consists of a blade, a hilt, and a crossguard, typically with one or two edges for cutting, and a point for thrusting. The basic intent and physics of swordsmanship have remained fairly constant through the centuries, but the actual techniques vary among cultures and periods as a result of the differences in blade design and purpose. Unlike the bow, spear, axe or knife, the sword is a purely military weapon, and this has made it symbolic of warfare or naked state power in many cultures."
