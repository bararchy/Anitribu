A hotel room, the sounds of a couple enjoying each other's company.  Then, a scream.  The player wakes up a vampire and looks at his sire in horror -- door bursts open -- Camarilla vampires rush in and seize the player and his Sire.
The player and his sire are handed their fates in front of the Kindred community.  Prince LaCroix speaks to the audience.  The player's sire is executed by the Sheriff.  Anarch leader Nines Rodriguez protests, walks out with his lieutenants.  The Prince spares the player's life."
