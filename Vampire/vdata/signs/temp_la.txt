You enter Downtown LA for the first time.  The Sabbat jump you as soon as your cab leaves.  They're about to carve vengeance out of your flesh in retribution for your warehouse escapade, but they're stopped short by the arrival of Nines Rodriguez and his guns.  They flee, and Nines helps you up.
If your story state was 5, it has just been set to 10.  Hope you didn't need it for something else."
