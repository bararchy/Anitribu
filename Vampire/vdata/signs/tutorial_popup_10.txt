Every lock has a difficulty rating. Your Lockpicking feat is compared to the the difficulty rating of the lock to determine success. If your Lockpicking feat is at least as high as the lock difficulty, you will pick the lock.
Note: Using the Blood Buff ability will raise your Dexterity to 5, and therefore raise your Lockpicking feat. You may use this to try to open locks that would normally be beyond your skill range.
Note: Lockpicking is a criminal activity. If humans see you picking a lock, they will call for security or the police.
Key card locks and electronic locks cannot be picked by traditional means.
