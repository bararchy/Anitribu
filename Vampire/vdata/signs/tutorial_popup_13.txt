Computers can be used for several purposes: accessing private information, turning on and off security cameras, and opening magnetically sealed doors.
Most computers are password-protected. It is often possible to persuade people into giving you the password, to find a carelessly placed password, or to simply hack the password.
Your hacking skill is governed by your Hacking feat. Each computer has a difficulty rating that represents its level of security. If your Hacking feat is greater than the difficulty rating, you have good odds of successfully hacking the computer.
To attempt to hack a password, hit CTRL-C at the password prompt.
Left-click to continue."
//RM: removed "If you fail, however, the difficulty rating will increase." from end of line 17, as this is untrue.
