The blue bar on the left side of the screen represents your health. If this bar is ever fully depleted, you will suffer a Final Death.
Your health will replenish slowly over time. The act of consuming blood will replenish your health more quickly. Replenishing health does not cost any blood.
Aggravated damage - damage from fire, electricity, sunlight, claws, and fangs - will appear on the health bar as yellow scarring. This damage takes at least twice as long to heal as other damage.
Left-click to continue."
