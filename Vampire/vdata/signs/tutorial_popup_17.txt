Vampires of Clan Tremere are gifted with the vampiric Discipline of Auspex. A Tremere using Auspex gains a number of advantages: they can see better in darkness, they can read the auras of other beings, and see through walls.
Auspex costs 1 blood point to activate.
While Auspex is active, you will gain a bonus to your Perception attribute. Perception contributes to both the Ranged Combat and Investigation feats.
To use Auspex, scroll to it using the ] and [ keys (by default) or with the mousewheel, then use the Power key (default right-click) to activate it.
Left-click to continue."
