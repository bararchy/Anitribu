Hit the Feed key again to stop feeding; it is important to stop feeding before you kill innocent victims.
Feeding has a narcotic effect on humans. After non-aggressive humans are fed upon, they will enter a trance-like state. Use this time to slip away undetected. During combat, humans will not become incapacitated after you stop feeding.
It is important that humans do not see you feed on other humans.
