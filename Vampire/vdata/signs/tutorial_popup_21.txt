Use the Feed key again to stop feeding before you kill innocent human victims.
Different feeding vessels provide different amounts of blood. Bums and other lowlife provide little blood.
Killing innocents costs you a point of your former Humanity, and brings you one step closer to the Beast Within. The lower your Humanity, the greater the chance you will suffer frenzy - total loss of control.
When you are low on blood and/or when you take sudden massive damage, you are at high risk of frenzying. Low Humanity scores multiply this risk.
Your Humanity can be found at the top of your character sheet.
