While passive Disciplines such as Obfuscate are running, a time meter will appear beside the Discipline icon tray in the lower-right corner of your display. This meter indicates how much time is left until the effect renews, and you are charged another point of blood.
The duration of passive Disciplines varies according to Discipline and level.
You may turn off a passive Discipline by using the Power key (default right-click) again while the Discipline is selected.
Unlike other passive Disciplines, Obfuscate's timer can be paused. As long as you stand still, the Obfuscate timer will not run down.
Left-click to continue."
