The powerful vampires of Clan Ventrue are able to instill fear and uneasiness in those around them. This ability is manifest in the vampiric Discipline of Presence. In combat, Presence can tilt the scales squarely to Ventrue's favor.
Presence costs 1 blood point to activate.
Presence weakens anyone near the Ventrue. As the Ventrue improves his Presence ability with experience, Presence will have a stronger weakening effect and a larger area of effect. At higher levels, Presence has a chance to incapacitate enemies.
To use Presence, scroll to it using the ] and [ keys (by default) or with the mouse wheel, then use the Power key (default right-click) to activate it.
Left-click to continue."
