The vampires of Clan Gangrel are renowned for their supernatural resilience. This ability is manifest in the vampiric Discipline of Fortitude.
Fortitude costs 1 blood point to activate.
While Fortitude is active, it grants a bonus to the Gangrel's Soak feat. Fortitude also guarantees a portion of all damage received will be ignored. Soak will be explained in more depth later.
To use Fortitude, scroll to it using the ] and [ keys (by default) or with the mouse wheel, then right-click to activate it.
Left-click to continue."
