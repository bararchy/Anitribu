Although it is a relatively short-lived enhancement, Blood Buff can make all the difference in combat situations. Physical attributes are the foundation of many combat interactions: Strength contributes to Melee and Brawl, and Stamina to Soak (damage prevention). A well-timed use of Blood Buff can turn the tide of battle.
Blood Buff costs 3 blood points to activate.
To use Blood Buff, scroll to it using the ] and [ keys (by default) or with the mouse wheel, then use the Power key (default right-click) to activate it.
Left-click to continue."
