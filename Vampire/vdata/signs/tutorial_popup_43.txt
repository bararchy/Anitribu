Thin skin doesn't make for great leaders. Clan Ventrue doesn't have this problem. In fact, they have skin of stone and the spine of steel to match. This trait is manifest in the vampiric Discipline of Fortitude.
Fortitude costs 1 blood point to activate.
While Fortitude is active, it grants a bonus to the Ventrue's Soak feat. Fortitude also guarantees a portion of all damage received will be ignored.
To use Fortitude, scroll to it using the ] and [ keys (by default) or with the mouse wheel, then use the Power key (default right-click) to activate it.
Left-click to continue."
