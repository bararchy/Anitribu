On the left side of the display, atop the health meter, is the area-type indicator. The different areas of the game are divided into three distinct types.
Combat Area:
The gun icon indicates that this is a combat area. In combat areas you are free to use the full force of your vampiric Disciplines without incurring any Masquerade violations. Likewise, there are no \"innocents\" in a combat zone. You can never incur a Masquerade violation or lose Humanity in a combat area.
