To perform a stealth kill, equip a melee weapon and approach a victim from behind while in sneaking mode. Once you are within the kill range, a special icon will appear at the bottom of your display. If you see the icon, you may use the Use key (default E) to perform the stealth kill.
The difficulty of stealth kills depends on both your Melee feat and your Stealth feat. The higher these two feats, the larger the kill range will be, and the easier it will be to get the icon to appear. More perceptive and better readied enemies are harder to stealth kill.
You may also perform a stealth kill bare-handed. In this case your Brawl feat is factored in, instead of Melee.
It is impossible to do a stealth kill with a firearm.
Use the Crouch key (default CTRL) to toggle between standing and sneaking modes.
Left-click to continue."
