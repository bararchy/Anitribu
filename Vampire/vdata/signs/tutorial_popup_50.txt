The Kindred of Clan Ventrue are known as leaders and puppeteers, aristocrats and opportunists, princes and profiteers. The signet seal of this duplicitous station is the vampiric Discipline Dominate. Through sheer force of will, the Ventrue can manipulate the minds of others, uprooting their mental wiring, even forcing them to do the Ventrue's bidding.
The individual levels of Dominate each have their own unique effects.
Level One: Trance
With Trance, the Ventrue can incapacitate targets from a distance. Only strong-willed supernatural beings can resist its effects. The Trance is fragile, however; if the Ventrue touches, attacks, or otherwise disturbs the tranced individual, the effect will end prematurely.
Trance, and all other Dominate effects, have the advantage of being covert actions. The Ventrue can Dominate a victim with nothing more than a gaze. Dominate therefore carries no risk of violating the Masquerade.
The individual levels of Dominate carry different costs. Trance costs 1 blood point. To use Trance, scroll to it using the ] and [ keys (by default) or with the mouse wheel, target your enemy, then use the Power key (default right-click) to activate it.
