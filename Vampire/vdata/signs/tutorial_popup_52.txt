The curse of Clan Malkavian bears a loathsome madness. Fortunately, the Malkavian needn't suffer alone. He can inflict his madness on others. The vampiric Discipline of Dementate represents the focused application of madness to invoke specific reactions in others.
The individual levels of Dementate each have their own unique effects.
Level One: Hysteria
Individuals stricken with Hysteria become incapacitated with laughter. The Malkavian can inflict Hysteria from a distance. Only strong-willed supernatural beings can resist its effects. The Hysteria is fragile, however; if the Malkavian touches, attacks, or otherwise disturbs the stricken individual, the effect will end prematurely.
Hysteria, and all other Dementate effects, have the advantage of being covert actions. The Malkavian can Dementate a victim with nothing more than a thought. Dementate therefore carries no risk of violating the Masquerade.
The individual levels of Dementate carry different costs. Hysteria costs 1 blood point. To use Hysteria, scroll to it using the ] and [ keys (by default) or with the mouse wheel, target your enemy, then use the Power key (default right-click) to activate it.
Left-click to continue."
