Lurking in the shadows has brought the Nosferatu closer to the animal spirits with whom they share the periphery of society. The vampiric Discipline of Animalism allows the Nosferatu to direct these animal spirits to frightening and ferocious ends.
The individual levels of Animalism each have their own unique effects.
Level One: Nightwisp Ravens
The Nosferatu may call forth Nightwisp Ravens to incapacitate and distract a victim. The effect is fragile, however; if the Nosferatu touches, attacks, or otherwise disturbs the stricken individual, the Ravens will disperse and the effect will end prematurely.
Nightwisp Ravens, and all other Animalism effects, are clearly supernatural in nature, and carry a risk of violating the Masquerade if they are witnessed by non-hostile humans. Animalism is therefore to be used with discretion.
The individual levels of Animalism carry different costs. Nightwisp Ravens costs 1 blood point. To use Nightwisp Ravens, scroll to it using the ] and [ keys (by default) or with the mouse wheel, target your enemy, then use the Power key (default right-click) to activate it.
Left-click to continue."
