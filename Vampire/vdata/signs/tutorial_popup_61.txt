Protean is the legendary vampiric ability of transformation, and a gift shared by all of Clan Gangrel.
Each level of Protean represents a physical transformation. These transformations are cumulative.
Level One: Gleam of Red Eyes
On invoking Protean, the Gangrel's eyes become glowing red and cat-like. Gleam of Red Eyes allows the Gangrel to see perfectly in the dark, detect heat, and conveys a +2 bonus to Perception.
The physical transformations that result from Protean are obvious supernatural acts. Protean should therefore be used with discretion in safe areas.
To use Protean, scroll to it using the ] and [ keys (by default) or with the mouse wheel, then use the Power key (default right-click) to activate it.
Left-click to continue."
