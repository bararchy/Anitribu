		Safe Area:
The Masquerade symbol indicates that you are in a safe area. This is the realm of mortals, where it is most important that you hide your nature. Cities and other safe areas make abundant hunting grounds for Kindred. If you feed in a safe area, quarry your prey in the dark corners where passersby won't see you. If you are able to seduce your prey, mortals will dismiss your feeding as a lovers' embrace.
Police patrol safe areas. If humans witness criminal acts, such as picking a lock or attacking an innocent, they will not hesitate to call the police.
