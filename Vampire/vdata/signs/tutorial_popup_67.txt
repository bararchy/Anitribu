You have entered Elysium. An Elysium area is the domain of a powerful vampire. Here, you will be unable to attack or use your vampiric Disciplines, with the exception of Blood Buff while lockpicking.
You will occasionally have the opportunity to feed in Elysium areas however, and draining mortals dry will result in a loss of Humanity.
