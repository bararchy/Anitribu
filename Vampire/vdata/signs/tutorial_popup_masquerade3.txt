As a Nosferatu, you will have to be extremely careful about hiding your monstrous nature. If you are in danger of being seen, you will see this icon appear in the upper-right corner of your screen. A small arrow will tell you from what direction you may be seen.
Your current number of Masquerade violations is displayed in the upper-right corner of your character sheet."
