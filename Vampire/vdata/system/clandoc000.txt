These tough women are normally of ex-military or law enforcement background and quite used to modern firearms, security technology, and unarmed fighting. Due to their greedy nature they are usually far from understanding the deep religious foundation of the Society, which as a consequence means that their Numina isn't up to the powers of the real believers."	// added by wesp
